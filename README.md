# StepClimber
My solution to problem 8.1 of Cracking the Coding the Interview, 6th Edition: A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs. 

Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming is used (instead of redundant recursive calls that needlessly use a ton of memory).
